Netlist only mode (no physical design is being done, netlist_only=False to disable).
Design supply routing skipped. Supplies will have multiple must-connect pins. (route_supplies=True to enable supply routing).
DRC/LVS/PEX is only run on the top-level design to save run-time (inline_lvsdrc=True to do inline checking).
DRC/LVS/PEX is disabled (check_lvsdrc=True to enable).
Characterization is disabled (using analytical delay models) (analytical_delay=False to simulate).
Only characterizing nominal corner.
